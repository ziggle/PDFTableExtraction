# PDF-2-Table with Power Query

## Description
This repo contains my work for combining a multi-page table using Power Query. I needed to perform this task to recover data for an audit. The technique worked so well that I decided I needed to save it.

## Description

A PDF file of a large table was generated and the original data was misplaced. I used Power Query to read the PDF document, which created a number of separate tables with headings and footers. I then performed the following operations:

* Remove headers and footers
* Combine tables,which were in wide format
* Converted the combined tables into long format for use in a standard report.

Purely a Power Query project.

## Install and Run Project

Nothing special. Vanilla Power Query.

## Technologies

Focus on M code.

# Links and Documentation

This work is a good example of how to use Power Query to recover data from a PDF file.

## Go Forward

* I encounter a lot of data in PDF format.
* I do not have access to Adobe Acrobat or other tools that make this sort of work easy.
* This give me an Excel-based method to solve a common problem.
